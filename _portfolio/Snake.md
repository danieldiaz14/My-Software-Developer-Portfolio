## Project Details

[Project Demo!](https://danieldiaz14.github.io/Snake-Game/ "Snake Game")
This side project was created with the intention of practicing object orientated programming. This was written using front-end technologies like Javascript, HTML5 & CSS3, as well as the Javascript library p5. I learned a lot when creating this project, I learned how to create an object, giving it some attributes and manipulating those attributes. I learned how to take user's input via event listeners and displaying those changes onto the board, collision of the snake object and the board itself. Overall I had a lot of fun and hope to improve it or add some twists to it.
