## Project Details

This is a freelance project that was mainly developed using the Wix platform via the request of the client. I was able to use my knowledge of web development to make this project follow the box model so it is presented quite nicely. I also wrote some custom code to enhance some of the details of the website. What I learned from this project was taking somebody's idea and making it into a reality, they had certain expectations that were to be added and it felt great meeting it. The best feeling ever was hearing the client's excitement when seeing the site for the first time, of course it wasn't perfect and some adjustments were made but overall the client was really happy.
