Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I am a competitive gamer, musician, and software Engineer. I'm sure you frequently hear all the time that a candidate loves software engineering or software development and it is their passion. But for me it really does go beyond just being work or a career. I wasn't able to go to college and earn a CS degree but that didn't stop me from pursuing my dream of becoming an engineer. I genuinely get giddy with excitement when I learn about a new sorting algorithm, a more efficient way of organizing data, or simply solving a programming challenge that I wasn't able to do before. It is so much fun I can't imagine doing anything else. What really peaked my interest in software development was that it connects with so many other fields of study, you can create an app that checks somebody's blood level, create an app that helps someone track their expenses, create a platform for someone to learn a subject that will change their life and boom you just touched on biology, finance, and education. The possibilities are endless with software engineering and the only limit is your creativity.
