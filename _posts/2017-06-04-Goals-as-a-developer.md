title: Goals as a developer 
---

Gaming has been a huge part of my life growing up, and the way it has captivated such a large audience and created its own culture is just incredible. As someone who partakes in these events I wish nothing but the best for this industry with hopes that it continues to sky-rocket and meet the same success as physical sports, maybe even having children one day that are competing.


As to how this ties with my goals as a developer, I would love to be part of a team that balances an Esport game. Esports are extremely competitive and thus the programming and work that goes into making it responsive, balanced, and fun may as well be the same as  attempting to solve a paradox; no one will get it right. Because the task is to daunting  it takes a driven passionate team to do essentially what is the impossible.
