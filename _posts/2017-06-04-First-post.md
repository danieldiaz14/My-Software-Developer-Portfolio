title: Getting into technology 
---
I have been into technology as long as I can remember, luckily I was born in an age where cell phones and computers were in pretty much every household. I remember getting my first laptop in elementary school, begging my mother to buy me one and she did. She was very hesitant on purchasing one for me because I was so young and didn't take care of things I owned very well yet.


Needless to say she was right and I ended up dropping that laptop and the screen would no longer turn on. Remembering how much my mother had emphasized how important it was to take care of it I started analyzing the computer and seeing if there was anything I could do not that I knew what I was doing.


Recognizing the Philips screw heads on the laptop I decided to unscrew them and  see what I can do. I noticed there was a able that wasn't plugged in and i plugged it back in and it started working. What I had plugged back in was a ribbon cable which is as easy as plugging in a USB to a USB port however at that age it was incredible to me and sparked my interest in technology all together.



From then I continued to learn about computers, the hardware required to make a computer run. The process of troubleshooting computers and learning how to remove malware and create back-ups for computers. Hacking video games to give myself and my friends an advantage over the competition, I did this by installing a custom firmware on my Xbox 360 and games on PC I would use a program called cheat engine. Knowing much more about programming, now I realize I was editing the memory stored in the ram of the computer which is incredible to me that I learned how to do that at a young age because YouTube didn't have videos that showed you everything just yet. Graduating high school I got a job as a helpdesk technician and that is when I began my journey with technology in general.
