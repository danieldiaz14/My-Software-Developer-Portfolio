title: The biggest Challenge you've faced when learning to develop
---

When learning to code for the first time I feel just seeing a screen full of lines and sentences that don't make sense is really intimidating. Those who have not made an effort to actually attempt to learn see it as impressive while in reality it's not that difficult. Once you get past the intimidation of conquering the random brackets and parenthesis you'll come to realize its a language and you can very much read it. The difficult part is translating your ideas into this language as there comes a lot of logic with that.

I don't believe I have faced my biggest challenge yet as I am still learning to code in general and have only recently gotten really comfortable with the syntax of html,css, and JavaScript. However the area I feel weak in is actually coding my thoughts sometimes. Something as simple as printing out only the even numbers comes with some logic behind it.

> You would need to make an if then statement.
> if (variable % 2 == 0) {
	return variable;
}

This code above is what starts that logic behind telling the computer you're going to focus on just the evens. You can't just say hey look at the evens you have to do in a way that it understands. In this case you're telling it if the variable is divided by 2 and has no remainders it is an even number.
This is the logic behind computing that I am improving in however is still quite difficult for me. It forces you to think in a completely different way then you normally would.
