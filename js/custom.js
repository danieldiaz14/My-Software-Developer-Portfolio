Software development isn't just a career path to me and to prove it allow me to share what I did during quarantine.\nI learned some node, read up on binary data, express, streams, event emitters, and solved some coding challenges.\nI picked up a game called world of warcraft and created a bot using node and a C++ library called simulation craft to create simulations and output those results on Discord.\n I simply did this because it felt more convenient to use and it felt like a good project because it would be something my friends could use and i'm solving problems.\nPoint is I enjoy creating applications that people will use. I enjoy solving problems and I take pride in learning how to make them better by taking user feedback and developing new features.`
